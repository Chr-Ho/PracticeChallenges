String Reversal:
Description: Write a method to reverse a string. This can be done by manipulating characters in a char array or using StringBuilder.

Fibonacci Sequence:
Description: Implement a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. This can be iterative or recursive, with considerations for efficiency with large numbers.

Linked List Operations:
Description: Perform basic operations on a linked list like adding nodes, removing nodes, reversing the list, or detecting if there's a cycle.

Palindrome Checker:
Description: Check if a string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case. This typically involves converting the string to a character array or using StringBuilder.

Binary Tree Traversal:
Description: Implement methods for in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal of a binary tree. This also includes understanding tree nodes and recursion.

Anagram Check:
Description: Determine if two strings are anagrams. This can be done by sorting both strings and comparing or by counting character frequencies.

Sorting Algorithms Implementation:
Description: Code and explain algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort, discussing time complexity and space usage.

Implement Stack or Queue:
Description: Create a custom stack or queue class using an array or linked list, implementing methods like push/pop or enqueue/dequeue.

Find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
Description: Use dynamic programming to find the length of the LCS between two strings.

Two Sum Problem:
Description: Given an array of integers and a target number, find two numbers in the array that sum up to the target. This often involves using HashMap for O(n) solution.

Balanced Parentheses:
Description: Check if a string of brackets is balanced using a stack data structure.

Reverse a Linked List:
Description: Reverse the order of nodes in a singly linked list, either iteratively or recursively.

Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String:
Description: Use a hash map or an array to track character occurrences and return the first character that appears only once.

Implement a Singleton Pattern:
Description: Demonstrate understanding of design patterns by implementing a Singleton in Java, discussing thread safety.

Minimum Path Sum in a Grid:
Description: Find the path from the top left to the bottom right of a grid with the smallest sum, where only right or down movements are allowed, using dynamic programming.

Java Collections Framework:
Description: Implement or explain the use of various Java collections like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, etc., for specific use cases, or create a custom implementation of one.
