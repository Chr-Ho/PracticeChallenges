Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST):
Description: Write functions to insert, search, and possibly delete nodes from a BST. This challenge tests understanding of tree structures, Rust's ownership, and borrowing rules.

Fibonacci Sequence:
Description: Implement a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Consider different approaches like iterative, recursive, or using dynamic programming, while managing stack space and performance.

String Reversal:
Description: Write a function to reverse a string. This can involve converting to a Vec<char> due to Rust's string immutability, demonstrating handling of ownership and lifetimes.

Two Sum Problem:
Description: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target. This often involves using a HashMap or sorting the vector for efficiency, showing knowledge of Rust's collections.

Implement a Linked List:
Description: Create a singly or doubly linked list, including operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. This tests understanding of Rust's ownership system, lifetimes, and possibly unsafe code for performance.

Palindrome Check:
Description: Determine if a string or number is a palindrome, considering case sensitivity, spaces, and punctuation. This challenge highlights string manipulation in Rust.

FizzBuzz:
Description: Print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz". This tests basic control flow and pattern matching in Rust.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
Description: Find the length of the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming. This problem checks the implementation of algorithms and usage of Rust's vector types.

Balanced Parentheses:
Description: Check if the parentheses in a string are balanced using a stack. This is an opportunity to demonstrate working with Rust's data structures like Vec.

Anagram Detection:
Description: Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other, considering character counts or sorting. This involves string manipulation and data structures like HashMap.

Implement Custom Iterators:
Description: Create custom iterators for a data structure (like a vector or tree). This tests understanding of Rust's iterator trait and how to implement Iterator and IntoIterator.

Sorting Algorithms:
Description: Implement sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort, focusing on in-place sorting where possible and understanding how Rust's ownership model affects these operations.

Memory Safety with Unsafe Code:
Description: Use unsafe blocks to perform operations that bypass Rust's safety checks, like raw pointer manipulation or calling C functions. This tests understanding of when and how to use unsafe code safely.

Concurrency and Channels:
Description: Implement a small program using Rust's concurrency model with std::sync::mpsc::channel to communicate between threads, showing understanding of Rust's approach to concurrent programming and ownership.

Error Handling with Result and Option:
Description: Write functions that return Result or Option types to handle potential errors or absence of a value, demonstrating Rust's error handling philosophy.
