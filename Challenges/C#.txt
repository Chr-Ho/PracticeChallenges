FizzBuzz:
Description: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five print "Buzz", and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Palindrome Check:
Description: Determine if a given string or number is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.

Reverse a String or Array:
Description: Write a function to reverse the elements of a string or an array. This can be done in-place or by creating a new reversed sequence.

Two Sum Problem:
Description: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target. This can be solved with O(n) time complexity using a hash table.

Fibonacci Sequence:
Description: Implement a method to return the nth Fibonacci number. This can be done iteratively or recursively, with considerations for efficiency.

Anagram Detection:
Description: Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other by comparing sorted versions of the strings or counting character occurrences.

String Compression:
Description: Compress a string by replacing consecutive repeated characters with the character followed by the count of repetitions (e.g., "aabcccccaaa" becomes "a2b1c5a3").

Implement Stack or Queue:
Description: Create a basic stack or queue implementation using C# classes. This includes operations like push/pop for stack or enqueue/dequeue for queue.

Binary Search:
Description: Implement binary search on a sorted array. This tests understanding of algorithms with O(log n) time complexity.

Linked List Operations:
Description: Implement operations like insertion at the beginning/end, deletion of a node, or finding the middle node of a singly linked list.

Balanced Parentheses:
Description: Write a function to check if parentheses in a string are correctly balanced using a stack or a counter approach.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
Description: Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming.

Sorting Algorithms:
Description: Implement algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, or BubbleSort in C#. This tests coding skills, algorithm efficiency, and understanding of C# collections.

First Non-Repeating Character:
Description: Find the first character in a string that does not repeat. This can be done with a dictionary or two loops.

Sum of Two Integers without Using Arithmetic Operators:
Description: Write a function that adds two integers using only bitwise operations. This tests understanding of binary arithmetic and bit manipulation.

Implement a Simple Calculator:
Description: Create a function that can evaluate simple arithmetic expressions like "3 + 5 * (2 - 8)" by parsing the string into numbers and operators.
