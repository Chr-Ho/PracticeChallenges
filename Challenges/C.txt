String Reversal:
Description: Write a function that reverses a string in-place or returns a new reversed string. This tests pointer manipulation and string handling in C.

Linked List Operations:
Description: Implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal of a linked list. This can include detecting loops in the list (e.g., Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm).

Fibonacci Sequence:
Description: Generate the nth Fibonacci number. This can be done iteratively or recursively, with considerations for stack overflow in recursion for large numbers.

Palindrome Check for Strings or Numbers:
Description: Check if a given string or number is a palindrome. This often involves converting to a character array or using pointers.

Binary Tree Traversal:
Description: Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal for a binary tree. This checks understanding of tree structures and recursion.

Memory Allocation and Deallocation:
Description: Write functions that dynamically allocate memory for arrays or structures and manage their deallocation properly to avoid memory leaks.

Sorting Algorithms:
Description: Implement algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort. This tests knowledge of algorithm efficiency, pointer arithmetic, and array manipulation.

Anagram Detection:
Description: Determine if two strings are anagrams by counting character occurrences or sorting the strings.

Bit Manipulation:
Description: Tasks like setting, clearing, toggling, or checking bits in an integer. This includes problems like finding the number of set bits in an integer or swapping two numbers without a temporary variable.

Reverse a Linked List:
Description: Reverse the elements of a singly linked list. This can be done iteratively or recursively, testing pointer manipulation deeply.

Implement a Stack or Queue:
Description: Create a stack or queue using an array or a linked list. This includes operations like push/pop or enqueue/dequeue.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
Description: Write a program to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming.

C String Functions:
Description: Implement standard C library string functions like strcpy, strcat, strcmp, etc., without using built-in functions to show understanding of string manipulation.

Balance of Parentheses:
Description: Write a function to check if the brackets in a string are balanced using a stack.

Two Sum Problem:
Description: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target. This might involve sorting or using hash tables for efficiency.
