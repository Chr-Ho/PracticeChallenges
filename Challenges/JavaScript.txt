FizzBuzz:
Description: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five print "Buzz", and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Palindrome Checker:
Description: Determine if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.

Two Sum:
Description: Given an array of integers and a target number, find two numbers that add up to the target. Return their indices or the numbers themselves.

Reverse a String:
Description: Write a function to reverse a string. This can be done without using built-in reverse methods to showcase understanding of loops or recursion.

Fibonacci Sequence:
Description: Implement a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number. This can be done iteratively or recursively, with considerations for performance.

Anagram Detection:
Description: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other by comparing their character counts.

Implement a Stack or Queue:
Description: Create a basic stack or queue data structure with methods like push/pop or enqueue/dequeue using arrays or objects.

Balanced Parentheses:
Description: Determine if the parentheses in a string are balanced using a stack.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
Description: Write a function to find the length of the longest common subsequence in two strings using dynamic programming.

Linked List Operations:
Description: Implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal for a linked list. JavaScript doesn't have built-in linked list structures, so this would involve creating one.

Debounce and Throttle:
Description: Implement debounce or throttle functions for handling events like resize or scroll to optimize performance.

Promise Handling:
Description: Write functions that use Promises to handle asynchronous operations, including chaining, error handling, or creating custom promises.

Closure and Scope:
Description: Create examples demonstrating closure in JavaScript, like a counter that keeps its count between function calls.

Implement bind, call, or apply:
Description: Manually implement one of these function methods to show understanding of 'this' binding and function context.

Event Emitter:
Description: Build a simple event emitter system where objects can subscribe to events and emit them.

Deep Clone an Object:
Description: Write a function to create a deep clone of an object, handling nested objects and circular references.

Find the Longest Word in a String:
Description: Write a function that returns the length of the longest word in a given string, often testing string manipulation and array methods.
