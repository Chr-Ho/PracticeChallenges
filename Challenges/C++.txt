String Manipulation
Description Implement functions to manipulate strings such as reversing, checking if it's a palindrome, or finding substrings. This can involve using C++'s stdstring class or C-style strings.

Linked List Implementation
Description Implement operations on a linked list like insertion, deletion, reversal, or detecting cycles. This tests knowledge of pointers, memory management, and dynamic memory allocation.

Binary Tree Traversal
Description Write functions to perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal of a binary tree. This includes understanding tree structures and recursion.

Operator Overloading
Description Overload operators for custom classes (e.g., +, ==, ) to demonstrate understanding of how to extend C++'s syntax.

Smart Pointers
Description Use stdunique_ptr, stdshared_ptr, or stdweak_ptr to manage memory, avoiding leaks, and demonstrating RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).

Template Programming
Description Write a generic function or class using templates. This could be something like a template-based container or a generic sorting algorithm.

Implementing STL Algorithms
Description Replicate functionality of standard library algorithms like stdsort, stdfind, or stdtransform to show understanding of iterators and algorithms.

Copy and Move Semantics
Description Implement custom copy constructors, move constructors, and assignment operators for a class, highlighting the differences between them.

Virtual Functions and Polymorphism
Description Create a hierarchy of classes where a base class function is overridden in derived classes, demonstrating runtime polymorphism.

Memory Management
Description Write a program that showcases proper dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, including the use of new and delete.

FizzBuzz with C++ Features
Description Use modern C++ features like range-based for loops, lambdas, or even coroutines to solve the classic FizzBuzz problem.

Exception Handling
Description Write code that demonstrates proper exception handling, including throwing exceptions, catching them, and the use of try, catch, and throw.

Graph Algorithms
Description Implement basic graph traversal algorithms like BFS or DFS, which might involve creating a graph structure or using adjacency lists.

STL Container Usage
Description Show how to use containers like stdvector, stdmap, stdset for solving problems like finding duplicates, sorting data, or maintaining order.

Multithreading
Description Write a program using C++11's thread support to demonstrate thread creation, synchronization, and data sharing between threads.

Lambda Expressions
Description Use lambda expressions to simplify code, particularly for operations like sorting with custom comparison or event handling.
