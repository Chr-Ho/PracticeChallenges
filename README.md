## How to Contribute

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

### 2. Pick a Challenge
Navigate to the challenge folder for a list of challenges.

### 3. Create Your Solution File
- Inside the relevant folder, create a new file for your solution.
- Name your file using the format: `[ChallengeName][YourName].[Extension]`.  
  Example: `FizzBuzzChr-Ho.go` for a Go solution or `TwoSumChr-Ho.py` for Python.

### 4. Document Your Code
At the top of your file, include the following information:
-  The name of the challenge you are solving.
-  Your name.
-  The date you created the solution.
-  Briefly describe the challenge.

Example:
-  FizzBuzz Challange
-  Chr-Ho
-  12/29/24
-  Prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz";
  for multiples of five, print "Buzz"; for multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz".


### 5. Submit Your Solution
Ensure your solution is in the correct folder for the language you used. For example:
- `Go/YourSolution.go`
- `Python/YourSolution.py`

## Challenges

Challenges are divided by language. Here are a few examples from each language folder:

### Go
- **FizzBuzz**: Print numbers 1â€“100 with special rules for multiples of 3 and 5.
- **Two Sum**: Return indices of two numbers in an array that add up to a target.
- **Palindrome Detection**: Check if a string is a palindrome.  

### Java
- **String Reversal**: Reverse a string using `StringBuilder`.
- **Binary Tree Traversal**: Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Compute the nth Fibonacci number.  

### Python
- **FizzBuzz**: Print numbers 1â€“100 with rules for multiples of 3 and 5.
- **Coin Change Problem**: Find the number of ways to make change for a given amount.
- **Linked List Cycle Detection**: Detect if a linked list has a cycle.  

### Rust
- **Binary Search Tree**: Implement insert, search, and delete operations.
- **Custom Iterators**: Create custom iterators for a data structure.
- **Concurrency and Channels**: Solve problems using channels and goroutines.  

### C/C++/C#
- **Memory Management**: Allocate and deallocate memory safely.
- **Operator Overloading**: Overload operators for custom classes.
- **Multithreading**: Demonstrate synchronization and thread handling.
